## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about`. Observe the error or unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves correctly configuring the `dynamic` import, particularly regarding `ssr` flag, to ensure the component loads correctly in both SSR and client-side rendering contexts.

## Additional Notes

This bug is specific to certain scenarios and configurations. Ensuring components are correctly loaded and handled within Next.js 15 is critical to avoid these types of errors.
